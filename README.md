# Publicis.Sapient Coding Challenge

## Tasks

Create a simple React carousel

## How it should work
* The 'active' carousel item is always centred in its container
* When you click the `prev` button, it should centre the previous item
* When you click the `next` button, it should centre the next item
* As you scale up the browser window more of the carousel becomes visible
* It should run in the last two versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge

### Clone repo
git clone git@github.com:Gunzalez/sCarousel.git
```
* cd sCarousel
* yarn start
```

## Notes
We will assess your work on the following basis:

* Documentation is lacking a bit, I usually use a combination of README.md and jsDOCs
* Unit testing was lacking, I'm still developing my TDD skills
* Does not work in IE, again, I had no time to debug
